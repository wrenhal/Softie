# Softie Cleanup

I've taken the HTML from the following page:
[Operation Softie](http://www.therealcasadaro.com/OperationSoftie).

## Reason for this project

I saw this project as an opportunity to teach myself some Markdown while preparing the file for better readability for myself.


I have converted the HTML to Markdown and am cleaning it up to make it more readable for me and to correct grammar, spelling and URL mistakes in the source.
Upon finishing this I plan to reconvert the file to HTML, make sure it is properly formatted and then send the finished product to the owner of the website since it is his work initially.
The owner of the information contained on the original HTML page is [TheRealCasadaro](http://www.therealcasadaro.com).
