# Softie Cleanup

I've taken the HTML from the following page:
[Operation Softie](http://www.therealcasadaro.com/OperationSoftie)
I have converted the HTML to Markdown and am cleaning it up to make it more readable for me and to correct grammar, spelling and URL mistakes in the source.
Upon finishing this I plan to reconvert the file to HTML, make sure it is properly formatted and then send the finished product to the owner of the website since it is his work initially.
The owner of the information contained on this page is TheRealCasadaro.
