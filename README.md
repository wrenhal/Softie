# Softie Cleanup

I've taken the HTML from the following page:
[Operation Softie](http://www.therealcasadaro.com/OperationSoftie).

## Reason for this project

I saw this project as an opportunity to teach myself some Markdown while preparing the file for better readability for myself.

I have converted the HTML to Markdown and am cleaning it up to make it more readable for me and to correct grammar, spelling and URL mistakes in the source.
Upon finishing this I plan to reconvert the file to HTML, make sure it is properly formatted and then send the finished product to the owner of the website since it is his work initially.
The owner of the information contained on the original HTML page is [TheRealCasadaro](http://www.therealcasadaro.com).

>I've now completed the correction and cleanup of the file.  At this point I consider this project a Release Candidate.  I'll be converting the Markdown file to HTML and see how well that converts.  I'll also be sending the finished files over to the original author for inclusion on his site.  I will not consider the project at a full release status at this point unless the original author gives me the remaining information to fill out the portions of the document that are not done.
