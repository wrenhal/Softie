# Operation Softie

## More than enough knowledge to become a capable Programmer, Software Developer,  and Web Developer and get paid money to do it

> start small, remain small, end up small

### Why are you here

* Do you want to work for yourself creating stuff with code?
* Do you want to work for someone else creating stuff with code?

### One Goal

Turn you into a capable software engineer that can write software, anywhere, anytime, for yourself or for other people and get money for doing it.

### What is meant by “capable software engineer”

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer) says a software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work.

### Ummm, in English

1.Is there a problem that someone will pay to have solved?
2.Is there a problem that that someone will for software to solve?
3.Can we create stuff that solves problems?
4.can we create stuff that is usable, maybe even fun to use?
5.Can we create stuff that’s secure?
6.can we create stuff that works?
7.can we create stuff that makes money, for both ourselves and other people?

If you can do steps 3 through 7, Check out the [link list](#), join the [mailing list](#). If you want to help others become like you [click here](#)

If steps 1 through 6 sound like you, but you're not making any money, or not making enough money, [check this out](#)

## How Long will it take to complete everything

You can start calling yourself a coder, programmer, or engineer right now if you like. Other than that I don’t know. Everyone is different, most of us aren’t going to take this serious and quit in the first couple of weeks.

Those that don’t quit will probably reach their goal before they complete everything. The goal is to get what we want, not to check a bunch of blocks.

**The question we should be asking, is what do we want and why do we want it?**

If you want to learn to create software because you heard “It pays good money”, you're in the wrong place. Over time everyone will learn and be able to create basic software and the pay is going to go down. The money comes from problem solving, critical thinking, marketing and selling.

> The brick maker will always make more money than the brick layer, because the brick layer will always need more bricks to lay. The most successful brick maker will try to put himself out of business everyday.

This isn’t a series of tutorials that will teach you how to lay bricks. This is commitment that will teach you how to build empires. If empire building were easy, everyone would be doing it. Most people are content playing on social media, watching tv, and hanging out at the club. If that sounds like you, you're probably not going to make it.

### Ok, So what are we going to learn

* We are going to learn how to create [production level software](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/68213/difference-between-software-development-and-production). This is software that makes money. You will be able to do it for yourself or other people. Either way you will get money.

### Math and Reading

> Math is going to help you learn to think the way you should be thinking when it comes to software, that’s pretty much it. If you don’t like math, that’s cool, you should still practice it. You don’t need to know a lot of math to be a successful programmer. You do need to be comfortable with math if you want to be a $150,000+/year programmer.
---
> We also need to read and we need to ready a lot. We are going to run into all kinds of problems and sometimes the only way to find the answer is to read. Reading is like any other skill. The more reading we, the better at reading we get and in turn, the more reading we can do. We will build a foundation of knowledge that can never be taken away which makes is possible for us to find and formulate new answers faster and faster.

### Additional skills

There are some things that we are going to learn along the way that are not necessary but, they are going to expand our minds and help of become better at programming and doing things faster. Both being a faster and better programmer will help us to get more money.

#### Everything done in PowerShell

Everything we have to do in a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) window or on a [command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) or [bash prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) will be done in [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell).

The reasons why we are doing everything [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) in PowerShell:

1. PowerShell was created and is backed by Microsoft.
2. PowerShell can be customized to do nearly anything.
3. PowerShell can be used on almost any computer.

#### Git Good with Git

All of the code we write will be tracked using git and `pushed` to [GitHub](https://www.github.com). Git is used by hundreds of thousands of individuals and companies around the world. Even [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft) uses git.

Anytime we experiment with front end code it will be posted to [CodePen](https://www.codepen.io). During the course there will be some projects that can’t be hosted on a traditional web server, for those projects we’ll use one of the following:

##### Full Stack Project Deployments

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [GoMix](https://gomix.com/about/)

Some heftier more complicated options are:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

#### Documentation

Everything written is written using a [GitHub flavor of markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown).

This entire course was written in markdown and exported to HTML so you could see it here on the internet. Because of the simplicity of markdown, as software engineers we can write our own markdown parsers that can do just about anything we can imagine.

#### Video

There are videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiuJ529_bakAN-zjxnyDDaw) about Coding, Marketing and Selling.

Whether we want to work for a huge company or in our basement, we have to know how to:

1. Write secure software that solves problems and people enjoy using. Even if the code is far removed from the end user, as in the case of systems programs.

2. Be able to market ourselves and/or our software.

3. Know how to sell either ourselves or our software

### Why these languages and programming environments

As a baseline all programming languages enable us to accomplish the same thing. Some programming languages are better suited for certain devices, platforms, operating systems etc… The language we choose to learn when starting out doesn’t matter so much as us being able to [grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) the core principles of computer science and/or software development.<!-- look at just changing the word grok to understand -->

Once we understand software development at a core level, we can [learn the basics of any programming language](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=casadshear-20&keywords=seven%20languages%207%20weeks&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&linkId=5340e270dbd27ea92c293de9e0acd1f8)
<!-- ![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=casadshear-20&l=ur2&o=1&camp=1789). -->

The languages, resources, and tools chosen are not only in high demand, but will give a diverse set of skills. We can also use these tools on the most common computers and operating systems to create software for the most common web browsers, computers, operating systems and mobile devices.

#### [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29)

C# was invented by our friends at [Microsoft](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us) _[Average Salary: $64,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/net-c-programmer-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm)_

Until recently (relatively speaking) C# existed primarily in the windows world.

At some point a company called [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) made it possible to write software using C# that could be deployed to any platform. Write a program in C# and deploy it to iPhone and Android. Well, Microsoft has been busy lately. Not in this particular order, Microsoft has:

* Bought Xamerin.
* Bought Linkedin, which bought Lynda.com.
* Open sourced the .NET Core Framework.
* Created the cross platform text editor [Visual Studio Code](code.visualstudio.com) for Windows, Mac and Linux.
* Incorporated Linux and Node.js into [Microsoft Azure.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/)
* Created the [Surface line of desktop and tablet computers.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface)

That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Microsoft is a massive company that has it’s tentacles in everything, to include 80% of fortune 500 companies. What we care about is the fact that we can focus on language and potentially write software for everything from iPhones to Xbox.

#### [Python](https://www.python.org/)

_[Average Salary: $92,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/python-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm)_

Python has a syntax that is easy to learn, fun, versatile, and popular. Python also comes pre-installed on Apple computers (along with ruby). Python is widely used in data science (cleaning data and crunching numbers) and web development.

#### [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources)

[Average Salary: $72,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/javascript-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,20.htm "$72,000")

JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript, is the most widely used programming language on the planet. We have reached a point where building a website that does anything remotely cool is impossible without using some form of JavaScript. Any program that can be written in JavaScript, at some point will be written in JavaScript, and since everything can be written in JavaScript (if we throw logic out the window) everything will be written in JavaScript, at some point.

#### HTML and CSS

[Average Salary $76,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/front-end-web-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,23.htm)

HTML and CSS are all over the place. They are in our computers, our phones, our TV’s, our cars, everywhere.

### Programming environments

#### Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code

We can use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code to do just about anything we can imagine. Not only are these two platforms used by millions of developers, they are maintained by one of the largest software companies on the planet.

#### PowerShell

For a long time, Powershell was used by systems engineers and administrators primarily to manage Windows servers and networks. Microsoft has open sourced PowerShell and it is now available on Mac and Linux, meaning we can use the same commands everywhere.

#### Git and GitHub

Git is a version tracking system. Git Hub is a place to store and track our versions online. Though GIt and GitHub are most commonly used with source code, we can use Git to track versions of almost anything.

Version control is a huge part of development in the real world, yet very few schools teach it. Even more so, the only way one would know about version control is if they were doing something that needed to be version controlled or tracked.

The moment we tell someone we have experience with version control and can show them our active GitHub page, they will take us seriously. We can actually show people the things we are working on and interested in.

#### [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Markdown was invented by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) in collaboration with [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) as a way to write human readable HTML fast.

Markdown uses a parsing system of the same name to translate plain text files into a varying number of formats, thus enabling users to create web-pages and rich text documents using plain text. I wrote this entire document using nothing but markdown.

## Proof that we are learning

When it comes to learning, practice makes perfect. It's not about quality, it's about quantity. <!-- Would recommend changing this.  It's more like "Perfect practice makes perfect".  It's a favorite saying of Band Directors because it highlights that if you practice something wrong over and over then you will play it perfectly wrong. -->

While we move through the curriculum we are going to make a lot of stuff and document what we’re learning, how we’re learning, and why we’re learning.

We are also going to connect with other people that are already where we are going.

1. We will create a website that will progress and improve along with our skills. From our website we can talk about:

    * what we are working on
    * What we are learning
    * What we are having problems with
    * How we solved those problems
    * Anything we think might be interesting

2. We will have GitHub repositories that we will use to:

    * Learn about GitHub
    * House versions of our website
    * House Versions of the software projects, web pages, text files, and other stuff

3. We will have a CodePen where we can:

    * Show off our HTML experimentation
    * Show off our CSS experimentation
    * Show off our JavaScript experimentation
    * Show off whatever else we can think of or find interesting and inspirational

4. We will join groups, forums, chats, and meet-ups.

### What tools we are going to need

1. A computer or access to a computer that we can install software on. Preferably under our own user account.
2. Access to the internet.
3. A place where you can take and save notes.
4. Personal Grit

> Nothing about being extraordinary is easy, if there were the word wouldn’t exist.

### Optional but recommended tools

1. A small note book we can pull out in 7 seconds or less and start writing. We never know when or where we’re going to have a good idea or break through moment.
2. A larger note book that you can carry with you in a backpack or something.
3. 2 Ink pens to take with us everywhere we go. People tend to forget to give pens back and for some reason pens want to stop working when we need them most, like when we're trying to write down a billion dollar idea, or someone with influence says “here’s my information, give me call”.
4. Two ink pens we can carry in a backpack or something. We can never have to many pens.
5. Lots of drinking water, it’s good for our brains.

> He knew the rules so knew how to break them.

Some of the stuff you see below is going to be confusing. There are going to be days you feel like you know nothing at all. This is going to get very very very hard. But you can do it.

## The Curriculum ~~Outline~~ - DRAFT

### Learning to Learn (DRAFT)

This section is the basis for a curriculum on learning that I am putting together. You’re not going to get much from the information that is here right now, but, if you Google the bold terms you will be led to information on the key concepts.

#### A better way to learn and remember

#### Holistic Learning

* Why do you want to learn it
* What do you expect to learn
* What will you do with the information
* What do you understand about the thing you want to learn right now
* After you study, what do you understand about thing you just learned
* Reduce your understanding so you could explain it to a five year old and they would know what you're talking about

#### Palace of the mind

#### Eudaimonia machin

#### The first 20 hours

#### 10,000 hours

#### The Feynman Method of Learning

#### Stages of learning

#### Dreyfus model of skill acquisition

#### The seven states of expertise in [software engineering](http://www.wayland-informatics.com/The%20Seven%20Stages%20of%20Expertise%20in%20Software.htm)

### Getting started

#### Go to [Free Code Camp and Sign up](https://www.freecodecamp.com) then

* [ ] Complete [getting stared](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

* [ ] Complete [jQuery](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
* [ ] Complete [Basic Front End Development Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

When we get to the section "Build a Personal Portfolio Page", don’t over think it, build it and build it fast. The Project will call for the page to be built on [Code Pen](https://www.codepen.io). At some point we are going to create a git repository for the page and possibly use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to make it a functioning website that anyone can access.

The portfolio page is going to come up again and your going to have all kinds of ideas.

* [ ] Complete [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

The Following will increase our knowledge of

1. JavaScript
2. Advanced programming practices and terminologies
3. Basic Project Planning
4. Critical thinking

**The result** - We will be able to solve sophisticated problems programmatically.

Throughout the curriculum we are going to have to write code, since writing code is the only way to learn to write code. We'll also need to setup an environment for writing code.

Earlier I said one of the development environments we would be using is Visual Studio Code (VS CODE). Since we are starting with JavaScript, we are going to need to setup VS Code to debug our Javascript and eventual Node.js related code.

[For instructions on setting up VS Code for JavaScript Debugging click here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/runtimes/nodejs)

Before we go deeper into JavaScript and other programming theories, we are going to Harvard to take an intro to computer science course. The Course will cover 9 problem sets that will take us from 10 to 20 hours each.

This is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer sciene and the art of programming for major and non-mahors alike, with our without prior gramgramming experience.

The course is taught by David J. Malan, and teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include: - Abstraction - Algorithms - Sata Structues, - Encapsulation - Resource Managment - Security - Software Engineering - Web Development

Languages include - C - Python - SQL - JavaScript - CSS - HTML

Each problem set is inspired by real world domains: - Biology - Cryptograph - Finance - Forensics - Gaming

Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (programming assignments) and a final project are eliglble for a certificate.

### Get Good with Git and Git Hub

Git and GitHub are the tools we will use to backup and control the versions of the programs we create, as well as share them with the world.

So, the first thing we are going to do, is go learn git! This is going to do a few things for us.

* Get us comfortable with our computers
* Get us comfortable with the command line
* Help us create different versions of our work
* Help us backup our work
* Prepare us for sharing our work

_Choose one or choose them all!_

* [A 10 minute read on what github is](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [15 minutes to learn Git with hands on practice?](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [A simple Guide to Git, no deep shit](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [An entire video series on git](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
* [Walk through every step of the Git process](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)

> Being comfortable doesn’t mean we can remember all the commands or understand Git or Github inside and out. If we can explain how it works to a 5 year old and know where to go when we get stuck, we are good.

_When you're comfortable with Git, move on!_

## Get your website up and and running

* Learn about site generation and host your website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

<!-- ### Step Three - Getting comfortable with math -->

## Advanced Knowledge

These are the same links as before, just in a different place to make sure we don’t skip getting familiar with Git, its important like that.

* [15 minutes to learn Git with hands on practice?](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [Simple Guide to Git, no deep shit](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

* [Walk through every step of the Git process](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)

> Microsoft has its own version control software, [Team Foundation Server](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/). We don’t need to learn about it now because, github is popular and does everything we need it to do, knowing how to use github isn’t a bad skill to have and github will make us extremely comfortable with version control.

## Things To Keep in mind

* Try to have git commits every weeek, most of the days of the week
* Try to pick one to two other languages to use regularly for solving algorithms and implementing projects in addition to JavaScript (good choices would be to pick one of C++, Java or Python and one of either Golang or Rust)

## For each item we should

* Take notes, on a blog, in markdowm , wherever, somewhere - not about what we read, or about what the instructor said - about what we learned
* Build something - even if it’s just a 20 line function that computes something we find interesting
* If we build something, document it and test it as approprate
* Do the exercises, build the projects fully, not some scaled down halfassery

### For the Project of our choosing

* Seek 103 other developers to collaborate on the project <!-- 103??????? -->
* Coordinate with the team to complete the project
* Build the project out to a full production quality application
* Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigourously test the final product
* Resove any legitimate issues found

### Once per month do two of the following

* Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what we learned that month
* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo) - on interviewing
* Read [this blog post](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html) on crafting a resume
* Do one lesson from [CUST 104: Business Communications](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345)
* Live stream what we are working on for an hour, or lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.

* Code another mobile application
* Write a guide or tutorial for your website or some other website or create a video tutorial and post it to YouTube
* Learn another programming language and use it to complete any of the back-end projects from Free Code Camp with that language as the back-end language.
* Redo any of the algorithmic type projects you’ve already completed from the course, in a language other than JavaScript
* Pick an open source project from [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) and contribute to fixing an open issue
* visit the [Free Code Camp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/) and pick a couple of the toughest questions that people are having trouble getting help with, and help them
* Code a Flash Card application, for jotting quick notes you can use to quiz yourself later
