<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer">Wikipedia</a> says a

<h2 id="how-long-will-it-take-to-complete-everything">How Long will it take to complete everything?</h2>

<p>You can start calling yourself a coder, programmer, engineer… right now if you like. Other than that I don’t know. Everyone is different, most of us aren’t going to take this serious and quite in the first couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Those that don’t quite will probably reach their goal before they complete everything. The goal is to get what we want, not to check a bunch of blocks.</p>

<p><strong>The question we should be asking, is what do we want and why do we want it.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to learn to create software because you heard “It pays good money”, your in the wrong place. Overtime everyone will learn and be able to create basic software and the pay is going to go down. The money come from problem solving, critical thinking, marketing and selling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brick maker will always make more money than the brick layer because, the brick layer will always need more bricks to lay. The most successful brick maker will try to put himself out of business everyday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t a series of tutorials that will teach you how to lay bricks.  This is commitment that will teach you how to build empires. If empire building were easy, everyone would be doing it. Most people are content playing on social media, watching tv, and hanging out at the club. If that sounds like you, your probably not going to make it.</p>

<h3 id="math-and-reading">Math and Reading</h3>
<p>Math is going to help of learn to think the way should be thinking when it comes to software, that’s pretty much it. If you don’t like math, that’s cool, you should still practice it.  You don’t need to know allot of math to be a successful programmer, you do need to be comfortable with math if you want to be $150,000+ a year programmer.</p>

<p>We also need to read and we need to ready allot. We are going to run into all kinds of problems and sometimes the only way to find the answer is to read. Reading is like any other skill. The more reading we, the better at reading we get and in turn, the more reading we can do. We will build a foundation of knowledge that can never be taken away which makes is possible for us to find and formulate new answers faster and faster.</p>

<h3 id="additional-skills">Additional skills</h3>

<p>There are some things that we are going to learn along the way that are not necessary but, they are going to expand our minds and help of become better at programming and doing things faster. Both being a faster and better programmer will help us to get more money.</p>

<h4 id="everything-done-in-powershell">Everything done in PowerShell</h4>
<p>Everything we have to do in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal">terminal</a> windows or on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe">command</a> or<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)"> bash prompt</a> will be done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell">PowerShell</a>.</p>

<p>The reason why we are doing everything <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command line</a> in PowerShell
1. PowerShell was created and is backed by Microsoft
2. PowerShell can be customized to do nearly anything
3. PowerShell can be used on almost any computer</p>

<h4 id="git-good-with-git">Git Good with Git</h4>
<p>All of the code we write will be tracked using git and <code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code>ed to <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>.
Git is used by hundreds of thousands of individuals and companies around the world. Even <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> uses git.</p>

<p>Anytime we experiment with front end code it will be posted to <a href="https://www.codepen.io">CodePen</a>
During the course there will be some projects that can’t be hosted on a traditional web server. 
for those projects we’ll  use one of the following</p>

<h5 id="full-stack-project-deployments">Full Stack Project Deployments</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>
<a href="https://gomix.com/about/">GoMix</a></p>

<p>Some heftier more complicated options are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a></p>

<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>

<p>Everything written is written using a <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown">GitHub flavor of
markdown</a></p>

<p>This entire course was written in markdown and exported to HTML so you could see it here on the internet.  Because of the simplicity of markdown, as software engineers we can writer our own markdown parser’s that can do just about anything we can imagine.</p>

<h4 id="video">Video</h4>

<p>There are videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiuJ529_bakAN-zjxnyDDaw">YouTube</a> about Coding, Marketing and Selling.</p>

<p>Whether we want to work for a huge company or in our basement, we have to know how to 
1. Write secure software that solves problems and people enjoy using. Even if the code is far removed from the end user, as in the case of systems programs. 
2. Be able to market ourselves and or our software
3. Know how to sell either ourselves or our software</p>

<h3 id="why-these-languages-and-programming-environments">Why these languages and programming environments?</h3>

<p>As a baseline all programming languages enable us to accomplish the same thing.
Some programming languages are better suited for certain devices, platforms,
operating systems etc…  The language we chose to learn when starting out doesn’t matter so much as us being able to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a> the core principles of computer science and or software development.</p>

<p>Once we understand software development at a core level, we can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=casadshear-20&amp;keywords=seven languages 7 weeks&amp;index=aps&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=5340e270dbd27ea92c293de9e0acd1f8">learn the basics of any programming language</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=casadshear-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1&amp;camp=1789" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>

<p>The languages, resources, and tools chosen are not only in high demand, but will give a diverse set of skills. We can also used these tools on the most common computers and operating systems to create software for the most common web browsers, computers, operating systems and mobile devices.</p>

<h4 id="chttpsenwikipediaorgwikicsharp28programminglanguage29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29">C#</a></h4>

<p>C# was invented by our friends at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us">Microsoft</a>
<em><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/net-c-programmer-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm">Average Salary $64,000</a></em></p>

<p>Until recently (relatively speaking) existed primarily in the windows world.</p>

<p>At some point a company called <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> made it
possible to write software using C# that could be deployed to any platform, Write a program in C# and deploy it to iPhone and Android.   Well,
Microsoft has been busy lately.  Not is this particular order, Microsoft has,
- Bought Xamerin
- Bought Linkedin, which bought Lynda.com
- Open sourced the .NET Core Framework
- Created the cross platform text editor <a href="code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> for windows, Mac and Linux
- Incorporated Linux and Node.js into
  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/">Microsoft Azure</a>
- Created the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface">Surface line of desktop and tablet computer</a></p>

<p>That’s just the tip of the iceberg.  Microsoft is a massive company that has it’s
tentacles in everything, to include 80% of fortune 500 companies.   What we care
about is the fact that we can focus on language and potentially write software
for everything from iPhones to Xbox’s.</p>

<h4 id="pythonhttpswwwpythonorg"><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></h4>
<p><em><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/python-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm">Average Salary $92,000</a></em></p>

<p>Python has a syntax that is easy to learn, it’s fun, versatile and popular.
Python also comes pre-installed on apple computer (along with ruby).  Python is widely
used in data science (cleaning data and crunching numbers) and web development.
#### <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources">JavaScript</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/javascript-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,20.htm" title="$72,000">Average Salary $72,000</a></p>

<p>JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript the most used programming language on the
planet. We have reached a point where building a website that does anything
remotely cool is impossible without using some form of JavaScript.  Any program
that can be written in JavaScript, at some point will be written in JavaScript,
and since everything can be written in JavaScript (if throw logic out the
window) everything will be written in JavaScript, at some point.</p>

<h4 id="html-and-css">HTML and CSS</h4>
<p>*<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/front-end-web-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,23.htm">Average Salary $76,000</a>
HTML and CSS are all over the place, our computers, our phones, our TV’s our cars, everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="programming-environments">Programming environments</h3>
<p>#### Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code
We can use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code to do just about anything we can imagine.  No only are these two platforms used buy millions developers they are maintained by one of the largest software companies on the planet.</p>

<h4 id="powershell">PowerShell</h4>
<p>for a long time Powershell was used by systems engineers and administrator primarily to
manage windows servers and networks.  Microsoft has open sources PowerShell and it is now available on Mac and Linux, meaning we can use the same commands everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="git-and-github">Git and GitHub</h3>
<p>Git is a version tracking system. Git Hub is a place to store and track our
versions online.  Though GIt and GitHub are most commonly used with source code,
we can use Git to track versions of almost anything.</p>

<p>Version control is a huge part of development in the real world yet, very few schools
teach it. Even more so the only way one would know about version control is if they 
were doing something that needed to be version controlled or tracked.</p>

<p>The moment we tell someone we have experience with version control and can show them our
active GitHub page, take us seriously. We can actually show people the things we are working on and interested in.</p>

<h4 id="markdownhttpsguidesgithubcomfeaturesmastering-markdown"><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Mark Down</a>.  Markdown was
invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber">John Gruber</a> in
colaboration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aron Swartz</a>  as
a way to write readable human readable HTML fast.</p>

<p>Markdown uses a parsing system of the same name to translate plain text files into a varying
number of formats, thus enable users to create web-pages and rich text documents
using plain text. I wrote this entire document using nothing but markdown.</p>

<h2 id="proof-that-we-are-learning">Proof that we are learning!</h2>

<p>When it comes to learning practice makes perfect and its not about quality, its about quantity.</p>

<p>While we move through the curriculum we are going to make allot stuff, document what we’re learning, how we’re learning and why we’re learning.</p>

<p>We are also going to connect with other people that are already where we are going.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We will create a website that will progress and improve along with our skills. From our website we can talk about:

      <li>What we are having problems with</li>
      <li>How we solved those problems</li>
      <li>Anything we think might be interesting</li>

  <li>A larger note book that you can carry with you in a backpack or something.</li>
  <li>2 Ink pens to take with us everywhere we go. People tend to forget to give pens back and for some reasons pens want to stop working when we need them most, like when were trying to write down a billion dollar idea, someone with influence says “here’s my information, give me call”</li>
  <li>Two ink pens we can carry in a backpack or something. We can never have to many pens</li>
  <li>Lots of drinking water, it’s good for our brains.</li>

<p>When we get to the section Build a Personal Portfolio Page, don’t over think it, build it and build it fast. The Project will call for the page to be built on <a href="https://www.codepen.io">Code Pen</a>, at some point we are going to create a git repository for the page and possibly use <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> to make it a functioning website that anyone can access.</p>

<p>The portfolio page is going to come up again and your going to have all kinds of ideas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>[ ] Complete <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">Basic JavaScript</a></li>

<p>The Following will increase our knowledge of 
1. JavaScript
2. Advanced programming practices and terminologies
3. Basic Project Planning
4. Critical thinking</p>

<p><strong>The result</strong> - We will be able to solve sophisticated problems programmatically.</p>

<p>Throughout the curriculum we are going to have to write code, since writing code is the only way to learn to write code, we need to setup an environment for writing code.</p>

<p>Earlier I said one of the development environments we would be using is Visual Studio Code (VS CODE). Since we are starting with JavaScript,
we are going to need to setup VS Code to debug our Javascript and eventual Node.js and other javascript related code.</p>

<p>Git and GitHub are the tools we will use to backup and control the versions of
the tings we create, as well as share them with the world.</p>

<p>So, the first thing we are going to do, is go learn git! This is going to do a
few things for us.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get us comfortable with our computers</li>
  <li>Get us comfortable with the command line</li>
  <li>help us create different versions of our work</li>
  <li>Help us backup our work</li>
  <li>prepare us for sharing our work</li>
</ul>

because, github is popular and does everything we need it to do, knowing how to
use github isn’t a bad skill to have and github will make us extremely
comfortable with version control.</p>
