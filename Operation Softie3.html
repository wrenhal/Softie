                    <p>You can start calling yourself a coder, programmer, or engineer right now if you like. Other than that I don’t know. Everyone is different. Most of us aren’t going to take this serious and quit in the first couple of weeks.</p>
                    <p>Those that don’t quit will probably reach their goal before they complete everything. The goal is to get what we want, not to check a bunch of blocks.</p>
                    <p><strong>The question we should be asking, is what do we want and why do we want it?</strong></p>
                    <p>If you want to learn to create software because you heard “It pays good money”, you're in the wrong place. Over time everyone will learn and be able to create basic software and the pay is going to go down. The money comes from problem solving, critical thinking, marketing, and selling.</p>

                    <p>This isn’t a series of tutorials that will teach you how to lay bricks. This is a commitment that will teach you how to build empires. If empire building were easy, everyone would be doing it. Most people are content playing on social media, watching tv, and hanging out at the club. If that sounds like you, you're probably not going to make it.</p>

                        are better suited for certain devices, platforms, operating systems etc… The language we choose to
                        learn when starting out doesn’t matter so much as us being able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a>                        the core principles of computer science and/or software development.

                        <p>That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Microsoft is a massive company that has it’s tentacles in everything,
                            to include 80% of fortune 500 companies. What we care about is the fact that we can focus on
                            language and potentially write software for everything from iPhones to Xbox.</p>

                        <p>Python has a syntax that is easy to learn, fun, versatile, and popular. Python also comes pre-installed
                            on Apple computers (along with ruby). Python is widely used in data science (cleaning data and
                            crunching numbers) and web development.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript, is the most widely used programming language on the planet.
                            We have reached a point where building a website that does anything remotely cool is impossible
                            without using some form of JavaScript. Any program that can be written in JavaScript, at some
                            point will be written in JavaScript, and since everything can be written in JavaScript (if we
                            throw logic out the window) everything will be written in JavaScript, at some point.</p>

                            <p>HTML and CSS are all over the place. They are in our computers, our phones, our TV’s, our cars,
                                everywhere.</p>

                            <h4 id="visual-studio-and-visual-studio-code">Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code</h4>
                            <p>We can use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code to do just about anything we can imagine. Not
                                only are these two platforms used by millions of developers, they are maintained by one of
                                the largest software companies on the planet.</p>
                            <h4 id="powershell">PowerShell</h4>
                            <p>For a long time, Powershell was used by systems engineers and administrators primarily to manage
                                Windows servers and networks. Microsoft has open sourced PowerShell and it is now available
                                on Mac and Linux, meaning we can use the same commands everywhere.</p>
                            <h4 id="git-and-github">Git and GitHub</h4>
                            <p>Git is a version tracking system. Git Hub is a place to store and track our versions online.
                                Though GIt and GitHub are most commonly used with source code, we can use Git to track versions
                                of almost anything.</p>
                            <p>Version control is a huge part of development in the real world, yet very few schools teach it.
                                Even more so, the only way one would know about version control is if they were doing something
                                that needed to be version controlled or tracked.</p>
                            <p>The moment we tell someone we have experience with version control and can show them our active
                                GitHub page, they will take us seriously. We can actually show people the things we are working
                                on and interested in.</p>
                            <h4 id="markdown"><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a></h4>
                            <p>Markdown was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber">John Gruber</a>                                in collaboration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>                                as a way to write human readable HTML fast.</p>
                            <p>Markdown uses a parsing system of the same name to translate plain text files into a varying
                                number of formats, thus enabling users to create web-pages and rich text documents using
                                plain text. I wrote this entire document using nothing but markdown.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to learning, practice makes perfect. It's not about quality, it's about quantity.
                                <!-- Would recommend changing this.  It's more like "Perfect practice makes perfect".  It's a favorite saying of Band Directors because it highlights that if you practice something wrong over and over then you will play it perfectly wrong. -->

                            <p>While we move through the curriculum we are going to make a lot of stuff and document what we’re
                                learning, how we’re learning, and why we’re learning.</p>
                            <p>We are also going to connect with other people that are already where we are going.</p>

                            <p><strong>The result</strong> - We will be able to solve sophisticated problems programmatically.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the curriculum we are going to have to write code, since writing code is the only
                                way to learn to write code. We'll also need to setup an environment for writing code.</p>
                            <p>Earlier I said one of the development environments we would be using is Visual Studio Code (VS
                                CODE). Since we are starting with JavaScript, we are going to need to setup VS Code to debug
                                our Javascript and eventual Node.js related code.</p>

                            <p>Before we go deeper into JavaScript and other programming theories, we are going to Harvard to
                                take an intro to computer science course. The Course will cover 9 problem sets that will
                                take us from 10 to 20 hours each.</p>
                            <p>This is Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer sciene
                                and the art of programming for major and non-mahors alike, with our without prior gramgramming
                                experience.</p>
                            <p>The course is taught by David J. Malan, and teaches students how to think algorithmically and
                                solve problems efficiently. Topics include: - Abstraction - Algorithms - Sata Structues,
                                - Encapsulation - Resource Managment - Security - Software Engineering - Web Development</p>
                            <p>Languages include - C - Python - SQL - JavaScript - CSS - HTML</p>
                            <p>Each problem set is inspired by real world domains: - Biology - Cryptograph - Finance - Forensics
                                - Gaming</p>
                            <p>Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (programming assignments) and a final
                                project are eliglble for a certificate.</p>
